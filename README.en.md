# deCONZ HomeKit Bridge

A HomeKit bridge for deCONZ/Phoscon that enables you to control your Zigbee devices via Apple HomeKit.

## Installation

This application is designed to be installed and operated exclusively via Docker.

### Using Docker

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/0x2321/deconz-homekit:main
```

2. Start the container:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -e DECONZ_IP=<deconz-ip> \
  -e DECONZ_PORT=80 \
  -v ./data:/data \
  ghcr.io/0x2321/deconz-homekit:main
```

### Using Docker Compose

Create a `docker-compose.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
services:
   deconz-homekit:
      image: ghcr.io/0x2321/deconz-homekit:main
      container_name: deconz-homekit
      restart: unless-stopped
      environment:
         - DECONZ_IP=<deconz-ip>
         - DECONZ_PORT=80
      volumes:
         - ./data:/data
      network_mode: host
```

Then start the container with:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

> **Note:** The `./data` volume mount is used to persist the database file that stores the configuration and HomeKit pairing information. Ensure this directory exists and is writable.

## Configuration

Set the following environment variables:

* `DECONZ_IP`: IP address of the deCONZ gateway
* `DECONZ_PORT`: Port of the deCONZ gateway (default: 80)

On the first start, the application will request an API key from the gateway. To authorize access, open the Phoscon web app, navigate to **Settings ‚Üí Gateway ‚Üí Advanced Settings**, and click **‚ÄúAuthenticate app‚Äù**.

## Device Support

Not all deCONZ device categories are currently implemented.
